## Important Dates

- Submission deadline: **Saturday, June 20, 2020 (9am Eastern)**

- Hans' birthday: **Saturday, June 20, 2020**

## Who will see it?

The link to the YouTube video will be posted on Hans' Facebook wall. Please do not mention this to him before it's posted as it's a surprise.

## Different ways you can contribute:

- Choose and perform one (or more) of the pre-written parts.

## Time commitment:

While this can take as short as ten minutes, it ultimately depends on your preparation and setup time.

## What you need:

- an audio/video recording device such as a phone or laptop

- a playback device and headphones/earphones

- your instrument

- a quiet place to record


## Download the Score and Click Track

Parts are arranged by register where 1 is the highest and 6 is the lowest. Parts 1-4 are in treble clef and 5-6 are in bass clef.

## How to Use the Click Track

- Download the version of the click track file you want to use onto your playback device to which you can connect headphones. Familiarize yourself with the click track; each starts with exactly two measures of clicks for each beat to allow you to prepare to play.

- Connect your headphones (wireless/bluetooth preferred) to your playback device and try to adjust it such that you can hear both the click track as well as yourself playing simultaneously. If your headphones are wired, make sure that they do not obstruct your normal motion while performing. Make sure the headphone audio is not audible in your recording.

- If you don't have headphones, use a silent metronome. Since there are two tempi, you need to create two videos (one for each tempo) and record two separate clips. If you do not intend to start on the downbeat, please indicate which beat you are starting on either in the video or along with your submission.

### Video Recommendations

- Orientation of the camera
  
  - Either landscape or portrait mode.
  
  - Try to get your face and at least half of your instrument in the frame if possible.

- Lighting
  - The best quality light source is natural light because it's bright and full spectrum which helps render colors better. It also allows your camera's sensor lower its sensitivity to light which usually means less noise in the video you are capturing. Since natural light might not always be available, use as bright a light you feel comfortable with and place it behind the camera facing you. Avoid shadows and different colored light sources as they can produce unflattering results.
  

- Backdrop
  - Try to find a background that is stationary, relatively organized, and isn't directing light towards the camera.


- Video padding
   - Start recording at least five seconds before you start playing and leave at least five seconds at the end. Smile!

### Sound Recommendations

- Sound Recording
  - Tune to a [440 A](https://github.com/violaaas/music/tree/master/arrangements/Tuning/440-A) if possible.
  
  - To prevent sound distortion, make sure to test your recording device to ensure that your loudest notes are not clipping (too loud for the mic to register which causes distortion and crackles). If the sound is clipping, move the device further away from your instrument when recording. For more information on clipping, listen to [this example of clipping](https://youtu.be/9uEtworGLrU?t=124).

  - If you have a separate microphone, it's usually more open sounding if positioned at a height above your instrument and 6 more more feet away.

  - Your recording device may adjust its sensitivity automatically (increased sensitivity when it gets quiet and decreased sensitivity when it gets loud), so you may need to put extra effort into producing a piano or softer dynamic.
  
  - Make sure the room is quiet.
    - Close windows (and doors)

    - Turn off fans/AC/heaters/air purifiers when possible.

    - Silence cellphone, computer speakers, tablets, TVs, etc.

    - Ask your cohabitators to be quiet while you record

## How to Submit your Recording

Upload it to Dropbox, Google Drive, or other file sharing service from which you can share a download link without specific credentials. 
If possible, name your file using the following format to make it easier for me to organize:

```
<your name>_<part>.<format>
```

Examples:

```
ChrisCho_part3.mp4
ChrisCho_part4.mov
ChrisCho_part5.avi
ChrisCho_part2.mpeg
```

Once uploaded, send me the link (chris.h.cho@gmail.com) and make sure I have permission to download it. If you attempt to attach the video file directly to the email, it may silently fail in which case I will never even know you tried to send it.

If everything checks out, you're done!
